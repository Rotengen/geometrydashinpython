# geometrydashinpython
Geometry dash, in Python! No Pygame, no Imaging, just ASCII art.


Installation needs:

Python 3.10 or newer

The msvcrt module, which is pre-installed on Windows(Likely doesn't work or other programs, so emulators could be used)

Toggleable constraints for user experience:

line 13, variable called "framewait", causes different frame loading

Higher numbers are slower but less glitchy

Lower numbers are faster but more glitchy

Play around with a good value.

Default is 3.
